# TabToSpaces
Takes the tab key being pressed and sends 6 spaces to whatever program is in foreground. It's useful to take programming tests on online quiz apps that normally make use of the tab key to skip to the next question. 

Just double click the `tab.exe` file you find in the [**releases**](https://github.com/stignarnia/TabToSpaces/releases) page
